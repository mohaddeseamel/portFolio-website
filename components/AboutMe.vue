        I am a developer, from the past art and design was part of my interest
        and combining it with the knowledge of web design gave me the
        opportunity to step into the front-end path. I am interested in learning
        new things, I consider commitment, discipline, and effort to be part of
        work ethics, and I enjoy team work to achieve goals.
